    Our goal is to create a fully functional hosted web application with a responsive and user- friendly
    interface
    for the current Professional Development Centre at UCSC as our second-year group project.
    The web application intended for all PDC users, including students, businesses, the PDC Coordinator, and the
    PDC
    Assistant Coordinator.
    OpportunitiX focuses on four major responsibilities. They are as follows:
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Handling TechTalks</li>
        <li>Handling Company Registrations</li>
        <li>Handling Internship Placement</li>
        <li>Handling Student Evaluation</li>
        <li>Managing other events conducted by PDC.</li>
    </ul>
    The PDC Coordinator manages all users, including PDC Assistant Coordinator, students, and companies. He has the
    authority to modify user data and access confidential reports submitted by companies. PDC Coordinator reviews
    evaluations of students and companies. He uses reports generated within OpportunitiX in decision-making processes.
